**DECODING MIPS ARCHITECTURE:**

MIPS instruction format and syntax are the bedrock of programming for this architecture. Let's delve into this integral aspect with clarity and brevity:

1\. \*\*Instruction Format Overview\*\*: MIPS instructions typically follow a fixed format, comprising fields for opcode, source and destination registers, immediate values, and memory addresses.

2\. \*\*Opcode\*\*: The opcode specifies the operation to be performed, such as arithmetic, logical, or data transfer.

3\. \*\*Registers\*\*: MIPS architecture boasts a plethora of general-purpose registers denoted by $s, $t, and $d, facilitating efficient data manipulation and storage.

4\. \*\*Immediate Values\*\*: Immediate values allow for operations with constant data, providing flexibility in arithmetic and logical operations.

5\. \*\*Memory Addresses\*\*: Instructions involving memory access utilize memory addresses to read from or write to specific locations in the memory hierarchy.

6\. \*\*Syntax Clarity\*\*: MIPS assembly language adheres to a clear and consistent syntax, making it easy to understand and write code.

**PROGRAMMING SAMPLE :**


add $t0, $r2, $r3            

sub $t1, $r5, $r6           

div $r4, $r5                     

mflo $t2                        

add $r7, $t0, $t1            

add $r7, $r7, $t2           

- $t0 = $r2 + $r3: Adds the values stored in registers $r2 and $r3 and stores the result in register $t0.
- $t1 = $r5 - $r6: Subtracts the value in register $r6 from the value in register $r5 and stores the result in register $t1.
- Divide $r4 by $r5: Divides the value in register $r4 by the value in register $r5.
- $t2 = Quotient of $r4 / $r5: Stores the quotient of the division operation performed in step 3 in register $t2 using the mflo instruction.
- $r7 = ($t0 + $t1): Adds the values stored in registers $t0 and $t1 and stores the result in register $r7.
- $r7 = ($r7 + $t2): Adds the value stored in register $t2 to the value already stored in register $r7 and stores the final result in register $r7.
